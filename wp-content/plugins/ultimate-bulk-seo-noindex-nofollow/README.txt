Ultimate Bulk SEO Noindex Nofollow plugin allows you to effortlessly noindex or nofollow post and pages in bulk. What used to take hours, days, weeks or even months to do can now be done almost in an instant

== Description ==

Ultimate Bulk SEO Noindex plugin is the Noindex plugin that you have been searching for. If you are looking for an eaasy and quick way to noindex a lot of content to recover from a Google penalty or simply to remove a lot of junk pages from your website, this is the plugin that you have been looking for,

Prior to this plugin there were limited ways to noindex and nofollow content on a WordPress website. Using an existing SEO plugin you were required to manually edit each individul post or page one at a time. This is a full page edit, which is a lenghty process. There are a small handful of other plugins available, but they have either not been updated for a very long time, or have a complex user interface. The final metthod was to edit the robots.txt file, and it's often quite complex for many users to use.

With Ultimate Bulk SEO Noindex plugin makes noindexing and nofollowing content faster than you could possibly imagine. All you have to do is visit the post or page list view page, check the checkboxes beside the content you want to noindex or nofollow, select what you want to apply to the post or page and hit apply. It really is that simple. All posts or pages will instantly be marked witht he command you sent.

**What does this plugin do?**

This plugin places a robots metatag in the head of the chosen pages which instructs Google and other search engines not to include those pages in the search index. While you might be thinking this is a crazy thing to do, it actually helps your rankings. Google are looking for quality, not quantity, so showing only your best content to Google will tell Google that you have a high quality website, and they'll reward you handsomly.

**Why is this plugin better than using the regular SEO plugins?**

Other plugins such as Yoast include a meta box with the option to noindex content, but the options to noindex and nofollow are in a tab within a tab on the post edit screen. To make the changes you must edit an existing post, go to the SEO section, click on advanced tab, click on show to search engine options before finally updating the post. If you have dozens, or heaven forbid thousands of posts, this is going to take quite some time to do. But with Ultimate Bulk SEO Noindex plugin you don't have to do that, and the process has been slashed to seconds, allowing you to bulk noindex and nofollow dozens of posts at the same time.

**Why did I make this plugin?**

When I was new to WordPress I knew nothing about SEO and got hit with Panda 4.0. That was when I decided to learn about SEO and the benefots of noindexing content. Unfortunately at the time there were no plugins available to do it quickly, and it took me months and months to clean up my website from hundreds upon hundreds of thin posts. It was demoralising and nearly drove me away from WordPress altogether.

Having stuck to my guns and learning much more about SEo I've taken on clients who would greatly benefit from noindexing content, but doing it proved to be the chore it always was. So i decided to put this plugin together to save myself hundreds of hours work on each site.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I know this is working? =

The meta robots tage isn't visible on the page to the public, with good reason, but it is in the source code. To see the tag view the page source (chrome/firefox/edge) right click ont he page and click view source. Another option is to place view-source: at the beginning of the URL. When you see the page source code search for <META NAME="ROBOTS" CONTENT="NOINDEX"> or <META NAME="ROBOTS" CONTENT="NOFOLLOW">. They're added in uppercase so they're easy to find.

If you aren't comfortable doing this there are a handful of free tools online that will show the meta robots tool

= How do I know which posts or pages are noindexed and nofollowed? =

In the free version you can see a blue switch on the right side column will be enabled for each option. If the switch is off then the post or page is set to index and follow.

Upgrading to the pro version will have a green and red indicator on the post, page, tag, category, product, product category and product tag list view screens. Green means follow and index, red means noindex and no follow. There are two columns, one for index and one for follow.

==Can I set individual posts and pages to index and follow again?==

You sure can. When you bring your content up to a quality level for Google all you need to do is flick the switch off and the post or page will automatically revert to index and follow.

==Does this work with other seo plugins?==

Yes, but you must make sure not to use the other plugin indexing and follow settings. Essentially, if you have for example Yoast set to noindex and update the post and switch our setting off Google and other search engines will still detect the index setting from Yoast. Likewise, if you have previously had Yoast set to noindex and use this plugin to set a post to index Google will use the most restrictive directive on the page, which in this case will be Yoast. If Yoast or similar isn't set our plugin settings will be the only ones visible to search engines.

Get the pro version and the settings that you set in our plugin will be duplicated in Yoast and others to prevent conflicts
