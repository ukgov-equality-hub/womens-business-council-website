Track Google Analytics Events on your website - Enables you to send an event when a user Scrolls or Click an element on your website.
== Description ==
> "Analytics is about tracking the metrics that are critical to your business" -  Lean Analytics

With WP Google Analytics Events, you don't have to write code to use Events in Google Analytics.

The plugin allows you to fire events whenever someone interacts or views elements on your website.
You can create a Google Analytics event when a visitor scrolls down and views your pricing table. Track video, banners, Call to Action buttons, email links, and more.

If you really want to know what people are doing on your website, the default options are limited when it comes to in-page tracking in Google Analytics.
Page tracking is not enough these days, and if you want to match measurable metrics for your KPIs, its necessary to use events.

Tracking events is usually done by writing JavaScript code, and that is not the WordPress way.
That's why we created WP Google Analytics Events, so you don't have to write elaborate code every time you want to learn something new about your visitors.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What Is Google Analytics Event Tracking? =
Glad you asked, here is our [Complete Introduction to Event Tracking in Google Analytics](https://wpflow.com/what-is-google-analytics-event-tracking/).

=  Where can I see the events in Google Analytics? =
 There are two places that show events in GA -

 1. The real-time dashboard under "events" - An event should show up here in (almost) real-time.
 2. The full report can be found under "Behavior" -> "Events". Note that it can take up to 24 hours to show up in this section.

= Do I have to write any code to use this plugin? =
Don't be silly. This is why we made this plugin. But on a serious note, this could get a little technical so take a look at our [Plugin Documentation](http://wpflow.com/documentation/ "Documentation") page.

= What are some examples of using events? =
There are many benefits of using events, and you can get very creative:

1. Setting event-driven goals in Google Analytics
2. Tracking in page navigation
3. Comparing call to action button performance
4. Understanding what percentage of your visitors got to the end of an article
5. Tracking contact form submissions
6. Track Links
