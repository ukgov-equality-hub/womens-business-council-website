		<content><![CDATA[Working flexibly from home has enabled me to work for the past eight years at a job I enjoy, while at the same time being there for my children for everything that matters to them, from homework to sports days and play rehearsals (plus, not having to invest in extra childcare). This works very well for our family, as I have a husband who has a very full-on medical job and is rarely able to take time off or work flexibly. I don't think this would have been possible 20 years ago in my job as part of a team on a magazine, but technology means that I can file all my work remotely and talk to my work colleagues easily using Slack, email etc. even though they are in the US (and in fact, my direct boss also works from home in LA.) I also feel I am more productive working at home in a quiet study than I would be in an office. You do miss office banter and possibly the ability to bounce ideas around, but on the whole I think it enables you to focus and to concentrate on work without distractions - or office politics.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[I considered going part time after my daughter was born, but technology and a culture of trust and openness at Willmott Dixon have enabled me to work flexibly and stay full time. Being able to start earlier and finish earlier means I have more time in the evenings to be with my family. It gives me a chance to catch up on my daughterÕs day before she goes to bed. Also working from home now and then allows me to drop my daughter off at Nursery so that I can be involved with her education and development too.I admit that I felt a little guilty about leaving early at first but after a few weeks it became the norm and now others in my office are starting to work similar patterns.I think agile and flexible working are moving in the right direction and that different ways of working are becoming more accepted in construction. Since my return there is now a structured return process in place that eases parents back into the work environment and culture. I believe more can be done in the way of peer support from other parents through potential parent networks.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[I joined R/GA, a digital innovation agency based in London, last year through a returnship initiative co-founded by the agencyÕs HR Director, Liz Nottingham. The question of flexibility was discussed very openly during the interview process and on my suggestion, I started off working four days in the office and one half day from home with the flexibility to amend this pattern after an initial settling-in period.My feeling on flexibility has always been that one size definitely doesnÕt fit all. The different working patterns of the parents at my agency reflect this. In my view it takes time to find a pattern that works based upon the role, team, cadence of the working week and of course childcare commitments. I am hugely fortunate in that my husband often works from home and so is able to do school drop-offs and pick-ups certain days of a week. Childcare is very much a shared responsibility for us and the flexibility in his role complements that which I have in mine.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[When our twin boys were born in 2001 we already had a daughter under the age of three and we needed to balance work and child care while considering the best arrangements for our children.Maternity leave was shorter then and my wife went back to work part time after 16 weeks. We took advantage of the 8am to 6pm nursery provision but felt we were missing out as our children developed and thoughts turned to me taking one day a week off work.I was working as a private secretary for a director general in the Department of Health, and at first I didnÕt think it would be possible.However, after discussion with the director general we agreed that I would take Mondays off but remain a full-time employee, so I worked longer days Tuesdays to Fridays.It was great to be able to take a day off to look after the children, though I sometimes felt guilty that colleagues were working when I was enjoying a sunny morning playing with the children in Battersea Park. That feeling soon passed.Back then very few men of my generation were out and about with young children. This has radically changed, which is surely a good thing, though clearly there is a long way to go.In my experience, my managers in the Civil Service have been more open to my request to work flexibly. It has always been a matter of negotiation and discussion in every one of my 10 different roles since starting working flexibly.I have gained two promotions and am now at deputy director level so it should not be a bar to progression, regardless of gender.Working flexibly at a senior level has been a really positive experience for me. It can only be a good thing for our health and wellbeing and something we should be proud of in PHE. It is good for us as individuals and reflects well on us as an employer.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[I shifted to working three days a week in February as my wife fell ill last summer and I have needed to spend time supporting her since then.   My change in working hours has coincided with a change in my role.  As a result, I have altered my approach and I am now able to plan my work commitments well in advance and review plans where travel is needed.  It has taken time to adapt to my new routine and I have found it easier to be clear about which days I work and which I do not, rather than change these around or operate on number of hours worked.  I work from Tuesday to Thursday and while I do look through emails on Monday and Friday, I try to keep everything at armÕs length. On the days that I donÕt work, my attention is on my wife, allowing me to be more focussed on my working days. It has been challenging to adapt to not being available to colleagues on Monday and Friday, while working at 100% on the remaining days of the week.  However, having a supportive and pragmatic boss, as well as a flexible employer has helped me enormously to balance my personal and professional commitments.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[So what flexible working means for me is that is has, frankly, changed my life. Having been part of the original Oystercatchers team from the start, it was incredibly stressful being a key member in a start-up with aggressive sales targets which in the end attracted a bid from Centaur Media.Now I have begun a new consultancy, Alchemists but I am still able to work 4 days a week which I agreed with my business partner, Vlad Komanicky, before we started up. This allows me to concentrate on my vineyard and family farm in North Essex, and have more time with my 4 children. Flexible working is the future. I am more efficient and effective now. At Alchemists we use tech to communicate more efficiently and can work on stuff together online. I never waste time. I get a lot more done. I earn more. Crucially I see my wife and kids a lot more, I am happier and less stressed.]]></content>

I wanted to come back to work. I loved my job but had no clue how I could be a brilliant mum and be brilliant at work. My solution, which Sky fully supported, was part-time. Working 4 days a week but with flexibility so that I could be at work when I needed to be and still do some drop offs and pick-ups in Newcastle.And for me it has worked.

		<content><![CDATA[As a mother of four children, the ability to work flexibly has always been important, but this became critical when my youngest child left nursery and all my children were at school. I was fortunate enough to have a really enlightened manager - who was willing to think and act flexibly - and he agreed to a personalised flexible full-time working pattern, which enabled me to start work early in the morning (7:00) and leave in the afternoon to collect the children from school. We also agreed a backÐup plan when occasional urgent afternoon work emerged, but the ability to pick issues up later in the evening largely solved any problems. This Òearly-earlyÓ arrangement worked for the family because my husband (who works for the Ministry of Justice) was able to negotiate a complementary Òlate-late patternÓ and look after the children in the mornings. We all benefitted: my husband felt fully engaged with caring for the children; I have been able to support my children with their studies and after-school activities; and, the children (now in their twenties) never considered us to be Òworking parentsÓ. This pattern wouldnÕt work for everyone and is ideally suited to couples. The early mornings are sometimes tough and the days are busy and long. Nevertheless, it has been rewarding to share the care and has enabled us both to progress in our careers. ]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[IÕve worked flexibly on two models for the last 18 months, following my return to work after having my daughter. The first model Ð 4 days a week, Monday to Thursday Ð enabled me to dive back into work in a nearly-full time capacity while keeping 1 day a week to have dedicated time with my child. In the 15 months I worked on this model, I accelerated my career and earned a promotion, which was great. I at times worked more than 4 days per week and probably didnÕt get the financial compensation for this Ôextra timeÕ. In my new role as a Director, I was keen to find a model that appreciated the true nature of our business Ð demanding full time work at times, but then also having some calmer periods. My new model is 180 days per year (equivalent to 3.5 days/week pro rata), worked flexibly Ð sometimes working 4 or 5 days a week when the demand is high, but also retaining the time IÕm owed back, either by working 2 or 3 days some weeks, or by taking chunks of time off. This new model is an experiment for me and for the organisation and no one else at this level works on such a modelÉ so, weÕll see how it goes!]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[I returned to work after a two year break to focus on my children and it was harder than IÕd anticipated. There was a real lack of options for my level, which offered any kind of flexibility, but then a job came up at Mencap, who are a very progressive employer.I found someone that I jelled with and we decided to job share - a completely new concept to me. ItÕs great for employers as you effectively get two heads for the price of one. My job share partner and I work fixed days each week, but we have built in flexibility so that we can respond to business and personal needs when they arise.    She is currently on maternity leave so I am working full-time, but flexibly, so that two days a week I can pick my boys up from school. Full-time felt daunting at first, but Mencap genuinely puts the needs of its employees first, trusts them to be professionals and get the work done. That approach has made all the difference and IÕm surprised more employers havenÕt cottoned on to the fact that a better work/life balance ultimately makes people more productive.You have to be very organised, but itÕs incredibly empowering and my team has adjusted well. They know that I am available if something crucial comes up, but they respect the time I need to spend with my children. As well as being more focused and efficient at work, itÕs been really positive for mine and my familyÕs wellbeing. My husband and I didnÕt want to perpetuate old-fashioned gender stereotypes. We wanted our sons to grow up seeing us sharing parenting responsibilities alongside work, so that they experience gender equality as the social norm not the exception.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[I requested a four day working pattern Ð Monday to Thursday - which my employer agreed to, in line with their flexible working policy. IÕm also home-based, as are most of my team colleagues, because we are located all over England. The nature of our work means that we can do our jobs effectively with just a laptop and phone. We have monthly team Skype calls and quarterly meetings at our head office or regional locations, which is a good opportunity to catch up.Although my job entails frequent visits to clients, I manage my own diary, so I can schedule visits to avoid rush hour. This makes for less stressful travelling, cheaper off-peak fares (a saving for my employer!) and just as important - I can often be back home in time for when my youngest son returns from school. I also value the fact that when I am at home, I can fit in some domestic chores,  and am much more efficient in getting things done, as there are fewer distractions, i.e. no one to chat to in the office!I probably wouldnÕt have chosen to work from home if I was younger and at the start of my career, because of the lack of social interaction, but now that my children are teenagers, this pattern suits me and our family life very well. ]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[I have been working flexibly for the last few years in my role as Head of Compliance in the investment management industry.  I work part-time, but increased my core working hours from 3 days per week to 4 recently.  The children didnÕt need me around quite so much and I was able to take on some additional responsibilities.  More recently, I have changed my working pattern again, so that I work my 4 days across 5, and work one of those from home.  This has allowed me to respond to my childrenÕs immediate needs and acknowledges that, as they grow up, their needs can and will change.  We have always found a way to meet both my familyÕs needs and my employers, and that is down to good communication between us.  My working environment is well organised, with meetings arranged well in advance which allows me to plan my working week to ensure that I am present when I need to be.  It helps that technology allows us to work remotely, so if anything urgent comes up I can still attend to it straight away.  Working a shorter day has been great for productivity.  Studies have shown that workers are not fully productive on a full working day so I feel my employer gains by me working additional shorter days rather than fewer longer ones.  My children get to see me when they come home from school too, and I feel IÕm supporting them as a stay at home mum would.]]></content>

I was able to work flexibly to pick him up after school and then I worked my hours later in the day from home. As a parent this was so important and as an employee of Greggs I cannot emphasise enough how this kind of flexibility and support is welcomed and appreciated.]]></content>

Currently I work 22.5 hours per week; 2 standard days and 2 short school hour days, with flexibility over which days these are, along with 4 weeks extended parental leave in the school summer holidays.  Of course there are occasions when I need to flex and catch up things later, but all my colleagues and managers are very supportive.  When IÕm working IÕm able to fully commit without guilt, and thrive on the different challenges of my work versus personal role. An unexpected benefit of flexible working has been strengthening of skill set, it has focused development of prioritization, decision making, communication and delegation.  Supporting such a flexible working pattern and supporting me to take time away on sabbatical whilst a bold and brave move for Mars, is also common across the business, and has also required me to take some risks and be flexible on the career path IÕve taken but IÕve been lucky that the people and company have let me demonstrate that this works across a number of roles; UK, Global and European, both within my area of expertise and encouraging me to grow and develop in a new function and to maintain a successful career path.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[IÕve had all three of my children while working in the Civil Service; my first in 1995, second in 1999 and third in 2001. Even back then it was possible to work flexibly. Though not as flexibly as today where our IT kit supports a myriad of work patterns and where very much anyone can work flexibly, not just those with children. I donÕt think IÕd have been able to juggle childcare and work without the flexibility the Civil Service offered me.IÕve worked in many different departments from Jobcentres (as they were called), the Government Equalities Office, the Home Office and the Department for Education. I was able to work flexibly wherever I moved to. While my trajectory up the ranks may have been slower because of working part time hours and taking maternity leave, my progress was not permanently stalled. ItÕs true to say that back then, where it was fairly easy to get agreement to work a 3 day week, for example, it was not so easy (depending on your line manager) to get permission to work flexibly within those 3 days so you could drop your child off at nursery and pick up at the end of the day. I remember being repeatedly marked late in one role for arriving at work a little after 9 am. Over time, the culture of the organisation has improved significantly and line managers are more understanding and supportive. I believe the Civil Service is able to retain many able and committed individuals because of the way it has allowed them to juggle caring responsibilities and a career. Now my kids are grown up I can look back with a smile at how it all worked out in the endÉ hard as it was juggling both!]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Aged 30, I fell pregnant with my first child and started to wonder how IÕd manage with a baby and a full-on job as a Sky Sports producer. I knew I didnÕt want to give up my job, but equally I wanted to take my son to nursery. I needed flexibility.So what did I do? I spoke to my manager and put together a request for a three-day week. So that I could continue producing my own shows, I agreed that my three days would vary Ð sometimes IÕd do a 9am-5pm day in the office planning an event, other days I might work 2pm-10pm to produce a show.Although my children are now eleven and nine, I still relish flexibility. When my dad was diagnosed with AlzheimerÕs a few years ago, the ability to have extra quality time with him was great, whilst still fulfilling my work and mum roles.In 2016 I took on a more senior role, and now work a four-day week. I have found that connecting with peopleacross the business at Women@Sky events has been really inspirational. Talking to people about what works for them can really help- so I would definitely encourage you to make use of the events.]]></content>

The use of Skype video for business on my home-working days, ensures that I can be ÔpresentÕ in every meeting, and continue to build strong relationships from a distance. Without the opportunity to work flexibly, I wouldnÕt have been able to progress within the company without considering a relocation.]]></content>

WeÕve found that the best pattern for us as a family is that we both work a nine-day fortnight, so we each have a Friday where we spend 1:1 time with our son.  When we had our second son, and I was on maternity leave, my husband changed his working pattern to four days a week, so that we could spend more time together welcoming this new addition to our family and supporting our elder son as he started school.  WeÕve since returned to both doing a nine day fortnight again.  Because we both work this pattern, it means we can swap our days if something urgent comes up at work - and weÕre both available to our teams if something crucial comes up while weÕre out of the office, but both of our teams respect that we want to spend some dedicated time with our children.  Working flexibly in this way has allowed us both to enjoy parenthood and work, and it feels like a good balance for us and our two sons, and for our employers.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Our average occupancy rates of desks was around 80%, and therefore having flexible working and moving to fewer desks than staff, enabled us to spend less on expensive London real estate. It has been embraced to varying degrees across the organisation with some people moving desks frequently and actively working from home, and others choosing to sit at the same desk every day. Some teams have decided for the whole team to work from home one day per week, and others work from home sporadically.  It is fairly common for all senior people across the firm to work one day from home per week irrespective of what gender they are, and personally I find that it is really helpful as I have so many meetings when I'm in the office, that working from home enables me to have some thinking space to actually do some work, so I'm often hugely productive. Some people don't love that they don't have fixed desks, and they find the open plan a bit noisy, but I think everyone appreciates the ability to work from home, and I think everyone would agree that it has increased collaboration and communication and also juniors learning from senior people in the firm.   For flexible working to work successfully you have to have a culture that is willing to embrace it, and trust in your staff, and also for senior people (men especially) to lead by example.  Given we have such senior men working from home, it isn't seen as a stigma that is only attached to women who have children, and it is widely evidenced that people are producing more work content by being able to work from home, so it's a win-win all round!]]></content>

My caring role involves facilitating appointments, managing all of my familiesÕ affairs, providing emotional support, dealing with education and healthcare providers and supporting with personal care.I work a nine-day condensed fortnight which basically means I fit two weeksÕ worth of hours into nine days and have a day off once a fortnight. In addition, when appointments arise I sometimesstart early in the morning, take the required break during the day and then work late. I also work from home up to three days a week which makes a considerable positive difference to my well-being.There are two main reasons why I work from home Ð it enables me to juggle appointments as my travelling time is minimised by being at home and it also helps me to manage my epilepsy by ensuring I get enough sleep.Flexible working has its benefits from a work perspective too. I sometimes work with colleagues based in other jurisdictions so I can have calls with them at what would traditionally be classed as unsociable hours. It also enables me to work at quieter times of day and get more done.I am very grateful for the support I receive from HSBC UK. They provide me with the opportunity to pursue a career together by working flexibly to provide the care and support required by my family. My team are very supportive, thereÕs always someone to have a coffee and a chat with and to make me laugh, even when things are really difficult. My line manager is equally supportive helping me to manage my workload, giving me a different perspective of things and just being there when I need him. Working at HSBC UK has made a huge difference to my wellbeing and that of my family.]]></content>

What is great is that IHG recognises this and allows me the flexibility to get my time back.I work 4 days a week with the flexibility of being able to work from home when needed which allows me to use weekends and any free time to focus on my second career as a professional Showjumper (equestrian). During the summer months I am often competing and travelling with the horses for 3 or 4 days at a time however by being very diligent with diary management and utilising all of the great technology made available by IHG (skype, Webex) I am still able to keep up to date and top of my job.In summary flexible working means I am more focused, energised and passionate about my role which means in turn I am able to genuinely represent IHG positively in the market to attract talent.]]></content>

Compressed hours offered me the ideal balance between playing an active part in her care while also continuing to progress in my roles within the bank.On a personal level I get to spend the day with my daughter which is fantastic.From a business perspective IÕve found that I have learned how best to effectively use my time.Overall the number of challenges has been very small. The main one was when a meeting or event was on a Tuesday when I was scheduled to be compressed however this was easy to overcome as on these occasions I would move my non-working day. The ability to log on from home is also great as it means that I can login early in the morning or at night to make sure that I get everything done. ItÕs all about compromise, I value the flexibility that RBS gives me so IÕm happy to be flexible as well to make sure that the job gets done and done well.RBS is leading the way in terms of supporting flexible working both in terms of compressed hours and also working from home. I've watched flexible working grow over the years and I think this is fantastic for both the business and the staff.]]></content>

The freedom that a flexible working arrangement gives me is invaluable. I am hugely productive, and I work long hours, but the flexibility I have allows me to broaden my interests and work with a number of clients outside of my main role. It also lets me pursue personal projects. I spend time reading to keep up to date on new developments in business, psychology and social sciences. I'm particularly interested in children's health and wellbeing, and am especially keen to work in this field. I use the rest of my time to focus on my own health, wellbeing and creativity - all of which is important to staying relevant and focussed in my primary role with the advertising industry. I believe flexible working makes me a better, healthier and more productive employee, and I would like to see more people given the option to work in this way. I think the UK's 33 million workers, their employers, and their families, would benefit greatly.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[The flexi-working initiative at Willmott Dixon has enabled me to start and finish work earlier whilst condensing my hours. This means that IÕm able to spend Mondays and more time in the evenings with my two year old daughter. Having the option to adjust my hours to better suit my home life has allowed me to stay working full-time - something that I previously wasnÕt sure would be possible after having children. I am extremely grateful for this as it breaks down many of the obstacles that can present themselves when youÕre a full-time working mum.I believe that the open and fair culture at Willmott Dixon sets a great example to the rest of the industry. Whilst IÕve already seen an increase in numbers, I would like to see more men working flexibly so that they donÕt miss out on family time and also to improve the equilibrium when it comes to childcare and household duties. Striving towards a better work-life balance for everyone will undoubtedly play a part in keeping people happy, motivated and healthy.]]></content>

It has also helped drive more conversation about flexible ways of working across the agency and with clients, which has been a great thing.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Since before our children were born, my husband and I have had our own business providing project management services to construction industry clients. Having grown up in a large traditional family, but with firm equality of status between my parents, I am very grateful to have had a parent at home, and was determined that parenting wasn't going to take second place to our working lives.For us, the solution has been that I have found a job share with two other contract professional mothers returning to work.  A key success factor is that our client has realised the benefit of letting us all work the same part-time hours. This is essential in collaborating to deliver the role as we have different areas of expertise.  We each offer 25 to 35 hours per week, depending on the workload, so we provide a very flexible resource. Core hours for all of us are during school time, so we have the opportunity to do the school runs and be at home after school.School holidays require careful planning and we ensure that two of us are working whenever possible. My husband works from home one day per week, allowing me essential catching up time, and I can log in remotely when deadlines loom. This has proved a very resilient work model for us.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[IÕve been flexi-working at RBS since 2018. I normally work from home 2 days a week and spend the other three in the office. I take our 6-year old boy to school in the mornings Ð it feels good to be involved. My wife works compressed hours 4 days a week, so she takes Friday off to be with our son. When work demands it, there are times when you need to help each other out, but generally this works well for us.Working from home is a big help in sharing the burden of childcare, especially when you canÕt rely on a wider support network. Flexi-working is inclusive as everyone has different circumstances Ð itÕs not a one-size-fits-all thing but is there when you need it. And it also saves money on travel, avoids stressful commutes, and improves my general wellbeing and productivity, which is great!Õ.RBSÕ technology, as well as understanding line management, helps you feel connected with the wider team.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[I have had various flexible working deals with ?What If! ranging from freelancer, 3 days a week, 3 days a week with school holidays off, full time and now as an Associate.My Associate Deal is a commitment (on both sides) to 80 days per year. Phasing the days is agreed mutually, but usually involves working pretty much full time on a project for 6-8 weeks and then having intervals of down time.It suits me because it means I can have a better work:life balance.  I had got to the stage where I was finding full time work quite draining on my energy and forcing all the other things I am curious about and interested in to the periphery.So far, it is working really well. I love doing my ?What If! work - the challenges, working with a team of smart, curious young people and I love that I can invest time in friends, family, culture, travel, passion projects in a way which keeps me fresh and energised. And because I know ?What If! well, I can contribute to on-the-project coaching, handing on my experience of previous projects but also I have time to invest in new ways of doing things, evolution of tools, techniques, approaches etc.]]></content>

On Monday and Friday my wife drops my son to nursery, and I pick him up at 4pm - the time I leave site depends on the site location. On these days I cook the family dinner and bath Elliot. On Thursdays I drop off my son at his grandparentÕs house for 8am and then head to site. The site teams I work with are all aware of my flexible working arrangements and we have early morning and late working rotas in place, as well as site induction rotas. On my first site placement, all three Building Managers used flexible working to help support them with childcare arrangements.    My working pattern, means I have to be organised with the scheduling of meetings, and I make sure I have completed everything I need to before the end of the day. I find I am more focused during the day, regarding daily duties on site etc.If I couldnÕt be flexible with my working hours my son would spend nearly eleven hours in nursery. Being able to work in the way I do, has enabled me to spend more time with my son and has improved our bond no end. It has also enabled us to have dinner as a family and spend some great quality time together.]]></content>

Being afforded the opportunity as a father to have a strong relationship with his children, which was also formed in their very formative years, is evident now in all of our relationships some 15 years on. Happiness is the key to success and flexible working plays a key role in achieving it.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[My work is based in the RBS head quarters on the outside of Edinburgh at Gogarburn. I live in the southside of Glasgow. I work 3 days a week in the Edinburgh office and two from home. My  commute to work can be between 3 and 4 hours a day. This means I am not in at the start and end of my daughterÕs school day. My 17 year old daughter has special needs and at the start and ends of the day she needs a lot of support.  I need to be home when she returns from after school the days my wife works late. She needs fulltime care and the days I am not commuting I dress, feed her and get her ready for school and cook her evening meal and feed and get  her ready for bed. The days I am working, my wife has to do all the start of the day caring and I get in towards the end of my daughterÕs day.This arrangement allows me and my wife to share the caring, and gives me more time with my daughter and son.I have not really experienced any significant challenges; most of my work is on the phone with others in other offices and even when I am working with Edinburgh staff we often meet via the phone or video conferencing.My line manager has been very supportive and understanding of my situation, for example she supports me when I have to attend clinics with my daughter or all agency meetings about her future. She goes beyond just support and enquires as to how my daughter is - I feel she and my employer genuinely care about having an inclusive workforce and supporting those that are carers. ]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[As a working dad, negotiating a flexible working arrangement has been essential in helping me to juggle my caring responsibilities with my career. The Ministry of Justice was one of the first government departments to introduce a family friendly working initiative: Finding a Balance and I was immediately struck by the number of male role models who were showcased. This programme enabled me to negotiate a bespoke pattern, with the full backing of my managers.I was able to spend time with growing family in the mornings and make sure they were safely dropped at the nursery and at school, which meant a 10:30 start at work due to a long commute into London.  My team and managers were aware of my commitments and meetings and targets were simply scheduled for later in the working day. It took a little getting used to but now huge numbers of staff work bespoke patterns Ð so IÕm pleased to say - flexibility in the new norm!]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[I work standard office hours throughout the week, in London Monday to Wednesday and from home Thursday & Friday. I have a daughter from a previous relationship and look after her 50% of the time; working from home two days a week allows me to take her to and from school on those days.Quite simply, this working pattern allows me to support a 50% shared custody of my daughter. If I couldnÕt have worked flexibly this wouldnÕt be possible and I would see her far less. I also now have a 1-year old son and flexible working has allowed me to spend more time with him as I am ÒhomeÓ much earlier without a 90-minute commuteIt can be challenging when face-to-face meetings are organised on my home working days, but I can usually move things around with enough notice.  Having fixed days from home at the end of the week does also often mean missing out on office social occasions!My employer and various line managers have been very supportive. From an employer point of view, we increasingly have new technologies to support home working, such as Zoom video conferencing that allows people to join meetings F2F from wherever they are. My line managers have always been very understanding and have helped me to manage time effectively so that not being in the office is not a disadvantage in any way.I previously worked a different pattern that varied week-to-week whereby I would work longer hours in the office in London and then school hours from home. Sometimes it was 3 in London, 2 from home, others it was 4 in London with 1 from home and also 2 in London, 3 from home. Because this varied it was difficult to ever explain to anyone what my working pattern was, but I always ensured my work diary reflected where I would be and when I was available. With effective and efficient time management, you can make just about any pattern work.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[The flexibility of working from home during the hours that work for me makes an enormous difference to my life and my family. Prior to this role I worked 3 days a week for 7 years after my son Albie was born, in roles spanning global marketing and UK Strategy - delivering value to Mars and enabling me to be the parent and partner that I wanted to be. I was promoted in that time which is a true testament to MarsÕ support for talent and not work patterns! Immediately before this role I was Marketing VP for the UK with a team of 70 and on the UK Board Ð I worked 4 days a week as the business focuses on quality of output not hours of input. To this day I maintain that my one day ÒoffÓ made me significantly better equipped to deliver my role Ð giving me space and perspective to rise above the Òbusy-nessÓ that comes with these roles and focus on what really matters. I am a passionate advocate of flexible working and valuing the work delivered rather than the hours worked.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[I work full time but I compress my hours into 9 working days each fortnight.  I spend every other Monday looking after my 2 children, ages 5 and 1.  I also work 2 days a week from home.After the birth of our first child my wife wanted to get back to work, so we decided it would be good if he wasnÕt in nursery 5 full days a week.  Working compressed hours allowed me to have some time with him on my own.  And it meant one less day of nursery fees!I spend more time with my 2 kids and have an even better bond with them. Working from home makes it easier for us to balance commuting with the need for nursery pickups - whoever is at home is only 10 minutes away from nursery, rather than 45.  My wife also does the same pattern which means that if we need to be in the office on what should be our off days we can swap which allows us to flex to the business needs as well as our own.With the help of flexible working I can perform my role in a way that provides me with a much better work life balance, without getting in the way of doing the job.I work with 1 other person who uses flexible working but by making sure we spend the same days in the office and plan our face to face activities around them we donÕt tend to have any issues.   In terms of working at home I find that there are days that it would benefit me to be in the office rather than at home which means I either swap days or spend more days in the office.  The biggest challenge there is making sure we have cover for nursery pickups and that I can book a desk in the office. My line manager was very supportive. When I first started this pattern it was on a 6 months trial to allow me or them to change our minds. 5 years later and no one seems to notice that IÕm not around once a fortnight.]]></content>

I was given the opportunity to demonstrate how this could be structured with my existing role and Vodafone have been hugely supportive in helping me bring this to fruition.As a result I have freed up my time to work with my local borough, education authorities and local businesses to start to build a preparation program for young people from the age of 16. This is a period of great anxiety for this group as it signals the start of their transition to independence.The new working model has also provided an opportunity for my team to pick up additional shared responsibilities aligned with their personal development and this move to part time will hopefully have a positive impact for all involved. Vodafone have demonstrated a forward thinking, flexible mind-set for which IÕm really grateful.]]></content>

Working 10 days in 9 with every other Friday off to look after Joseph allowed us to limit the number of days that he initially went to nursery, helping to get him ready for school gradually, and saving a bit of money on childcare bills!.  There were some challenges, and Thursdays were often busy, but that chance to spend some regular father-son time with Joseph was priceless. I taught him to ride his bike and took him on his first camping trip on these days, which are memories I will never forget. When he started school earlier this year I reverted to full-time, but now use flexi-time to drop him off each morning and pick him up from school early every other Friday, which is a treat. I've been very grateful to be able to balance my work and home life like this, and pleased by how supportive bosses and colleagues have been.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Throughout my returning to practice training I was able to complete my required hours by doing 3 days a week.  The department were very supportive and flexible in allowing me to work which days suited me best.  Upon starting back work officially as a Diagnostic Radiographer the department again was happy for me to undertake 3 days a week work which suited me and my husband.  My husband was able to plan out his working days around when I was due to work, so when he had his days off I was at work and vice versa.  My family were also very supportive and helped with childcare whenever we needed it.  It was tricky at first and initially I had my reservations that it would work but 3 years on and itÕs worked out great.  IÕm now slowly building up to full time hours with both my children starting full time at school it has become a lot easier.If you are considering returning to practice, IÕd say go for it! ItÕs not as difficult as you imagine it to be and donÕt be afraid to contact people to ask for help to get started. I found a return to practice radiography course which included clinical placements at nearby University Hospital Leicester. It will be nerve-racking when you first start back but that will pass and itÕs well worth it in the end!]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[As father to 2 year old identical twins, parenthood has always involved juggling urgent priorities. And it has always been really important to me to play a full and active part in my childrenÕs lives; work needs to manage around that.When my girls were 6 months old my wife went back to work full-time, at my request, and I took over looking after them day-to-day on shared parental leave. It was a massive sacrifice for her to give up 6 months of her maternity leave, but one she gladly made for our family.  It was the most amazing 6 months, and I am eternally grateful.Once I reached the end of my 6 months of parental leave I returned to work 4 days a week, and my wife dropped down to 4 days as well. We both have the same day off, Friday, which let's us spend 3 days together as a family. It also provides a bit of insurance if one of us needs to travel for work, although we have only had to use that twice in 18 months.My employer has been very supportive, and never questioned whether it was possible to do my role on 4 days a week. Fridays are protected and moving down to 4 days hasn't stopped me being home for bath time whenever I'm not travelling.It's really important for our business, and for all businesses, to have leaders who demonstrate that flexible working is effective, and can even be encouraged. I don't really like the term role-model, but it is really gratifying to be told that your example has encouraged others.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[I work from home Mon-Fri. This allows me to take my 2 children to school most mornings, and saves money on childcare. It also means I spend more time with my children and save money. It can be tricky sometimes managing meetings with customers when I have to leave early in the morning because of long driving times. My line manager has given me the flexibility to get on with the job, essentially. He has a fairly light touch approach, which suits me perfectly. It isnÕt for everyone, being alone so long, but I would definitely recommend it to others to consider it if they can stomach their own company for 8 hours!]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[I currently work 28 hours a week over 4 days (having a Wednesday off as a rest mid-week). I have flexibility in my role so can do 2 days working from home and 2 days in the office but generally do 3 days in the office and 1 from home I have MS (Multiple Sclerosis) and find a full 35 hour week exhausting to the extent that I canÕt enjoy family time at the weekend. A little over 4 years ago I made the decision to reduce my hours to give me a break during the week. This has given me my weekends back and IÕm so glad that I made the decision.The benefits are easy Ð more energy to enjoy the weekend and the business has benefitted to, as I am able to bring the best of myself on the days when IÕm working. If I am not feeling great on any day, I have the flexibility to work from home to avoid the commute.In all honesty the biggest challenge is coming into a fuller inbox in the morning after my day off Ð sometimes it can feel like youÕve been on holiday. Inevitably you will miss some meetings or updates on your day off but with modern technology itÕs easy to get back up to speed.My line manager has been very supportive and fully supports flexible working. A number of people in my team work different patterns, from part time to compressed working weeks. The bank is also very supportive of different ways of working and has embraced working from home and flexible working spaces such as hub-sites and areas where you can book a desk in a different location to your main site. We have a weekly team meeting on a Thursday so everyone attends that and flexes their work week around that day.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Sam: ItÕs useful to have a second brain and we often spark ideas off one another. We work well together and we get on. We sometimes think in different ways, so it can be great to get an alternative perspective.Will: We hear a lot about flexible working, but I see it differently. Non-standard hours are not ÔflexibleÕ Ð itÕs the 9-5, five-days-a-week kind of hours that are inflexible. If we can move away from set thinking about how and when we work, we create more opportunities for everyone.Sam: ÒWhen we took on this role we made a conscious decision to be advocates and role models for flexibility. We are no less ambitious or any less committed because we are choosing to do a job-share. We have a big role and a strategy to deliver. This isnÕt a case of us Ôleaning outÕ - itÕs a trade-off for a period of time with our families. Flexibility is integral to modern business. Good people will leave if it isnÕt there.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[When I first fell pregnant, I had started to reap the rewards of 5 years of study to qualify as a chartered surveyor and working through a deep recession. I did not want to give up my career, but also could not see how I could balance my job with a new family, as I worked long hours in London.My employers agreed that I could return on a 3 day week. I found this stressful however, as there was an expectation to complete the work of 5 days in 3 and I got calls from the office on my days off.  Overnight trips proved difficult, especially if my child was sick.An opportunity arose within a new property company based at home. I was clear about my working days - Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays Ð this pattern meant that if I was ever needed by the office on a non-working day - I would always be in the office tomorrow. The pattern also made managing matters at home easier, as I was never working two days in a row, and could accommodate parent consultations, sports days and performances. This arrangement worked well for 18 years. During this time I had two further children with maternity leave, became Company Secretary, a Director and finally Chief Executive! Now my children are much older, I flex my working days more.These two different environments taught me the need for an agreed working structure, mutual respect for it, and realistic expectations of what can be achieved. When all of these are present, combining a career and family is hugely rewarding and confidence boosting. Whilst there have been situations where my family time has been compromised, these are far outweighed by the financial benefit of working, which all of the family members benefit from.  ]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[I work full-time, but there are two weeks a year I donÕt work. I take these in August when both Houses of Commons and Lords are typically on recess, so itÕs generally a quieter period for my team. This pattern means our family can spend dedicated time together over the summer and also that my partner and I can cover most of the school holidays between us. We donÕt have any family living nearby, so this is important to us. My working week involves working from home two days a week when I can be around for school drop-off and pick-up and also that all important networking with parents and teachers.My partner works a similar pattern, so we only need childcare for one day a week. The key to making this pattern work is good communication, organisation and the technology thatÕs available today. I submitted a business case after thinking through the requirements on the work and home front and then discussing these with my manager. There's inevitably a period of adjustment with a new pattern,  but these challenges can be worked through in a collaborative environment and the benefits are significant. I feel lucky to have a pattern that enables me to do a rewarding job, while not missing out on quality time with my children as they grow-up.]]></content>

It works really well, the twins get the best of both of us and we get equal time with them. My husband, who is a building manager, was a bit nervous about proposing dropping a day a fortnight. He put it to his boss that if he was off on holiday his construction manager would need to cover for him. He neednÕt have worried, though, he said it was the easiest conversation he ever had. I knew that my boss would say yes because I was already working four days a week. The arrangement would mean I was doing one day a fortnight more. As my job is office-based and my husband is on site I am more flexible during the week which means it is easier for me to do drop-offs and pick-ups of children as I can pick up work in the evenings if I need to. Both of us share time off for sick children, based on whose diary is the busiest at the time.]]></content>

I decided to work flexibly to spend more time with my young children, reduce childcare / travel costs and to rethink my approach to work/personal life. The benefits of this working pattern are being able to be part of taking and picking up my children to nursery and school. These are special moments and the child you interact with in the morning / afternoon versus the one when you arrive home late from work can be very different. Fun FridayÕs in our house are always a hit.The ability to work from home when your day doesnÕt merit a trip into the office is extremely helpful in helping you be more efficient, reducing the stress of public transport and giving you some more time back in the evening. The challenge IÕve had with this working pattern is rethinking how I plan my working week. IÕve had to beef up my prioritisation skills to ensure I make the most of my 4 days in the office. Equally, disciplining myself to switch off on a Friday and focus my energy on my time with my children. My employer/line manager has supported me by firstly embracing the idea and allowing me to demonstrate that it would not have any detrimental impact on my performance. ItÕs had the opposite effect as I now feel like I am more productive and happier when I am at work as IÕm not making any significant trade offs at home to further my career. ]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Since the birth of my first child in 2008 I have been able to balance a career I am passionate about with spending quality time with my family by taking advantage of job sharing, a form of flexible working which I think is still underutilised yet has enormous benefits for both the employer and the employee.I have worked with two different job share partners and both times I have been able to work the first three days of the working week with my job share partner working the later three days. This enabled us to have a Ôcross-overÕ day in the office where we could catch up and discuss work priorities.As a working mum with a long commute I found working as a job share not only meant that I wasnÕt coming back into work at the start of the week to an overwhelming inbox but it also enriched the work I delivered and my job satisfaction Ð there is truth in the old adage that Ôtwo heads are better than oneÕ. In both of my job share roles I have enjoyed being able to bounce ideas off someone else and take on board any differing perspectives and ideas they might have. It definitely improved our productivity, creativity and commitment to success in that role. It also enabled us to balance a stretching job with caring commitments.]]></content>

It seems totally logical to try and be around for them as much as I can and my employer has been super flexible.  Once theyÕre both in school I think weÕll try and shift to a more Scandi model of shorter days (maybe 4 days over 5) so we can spend time together as a family most days though that may be a challenge to fit around clients working on a more traditional 9-6 schedule.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Alex Grieve, Executive Creative Director at AMV BBDO, commented: ÒIf you want to pioneer a new way of working, work with the very best pioneers. 50%of VerityÕs time is worth a 100% of most. WeÕre very lucky to have her.ÓVerity Fenner added: ÒIÕm delighted to be a pioneer in this fantastic scheme, which will hopefully kick start initiatives not only across our industry, but all others too. Working on a permanent contract, but only 2 _ days a week, gives me so much flexibility with not only work, but with my 2 year old Son too. ItÕs the dream more people should be asking for and pushing for. DadÕs too. Lots of agencies talk about these things but donÕt actually follow through, so IÕm determined to shine a light on AMVÕs willingness to try something new thatÕs so desperately needed. Ò]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[IÕve worked part time since returning from my first maternity leave in 2004. Whilst working part time IÕve had three significant promotions, the first in 2005, to run the Regulatory & Competition legal team, the second in July 2016 to UK General Counsel and the third in 2019 to Sky Group General Counsel. It has been challenging, but I feel lucky to have the best of both worlds Ð an incredibly interesting and engaging job, and the ability to spend time with the boys and I wouldnÕt change it for anything.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Being offered this kind of flexibility has meant that I am able to be part of the workforce and still meet some of my caring responsibilities. This is very important to me - intellectually, emotionally and financially.In offering flexible working, companies can cheaply access an experienced and enthusiastic talent pool.  There are millions of people who are unable to commit to a conventional, full-time job, and yet who are skilled, experienced and keen to work.  Companies who can offer them employment will build a loyal, productive, efficient and diverse workforce.  We know that there is a positive, measurable correlation between teams who embrace cognitive diversity and teams who exhibit high performance levels.  The successful company of the future will clearly be a company with a wide range of working patterns worked by a wide range of individuals.]]></content>
