For a 2-3 week period I flexed my working hours to be able to do this, I was in the office during school hours, I was able to spend some time with my son after school and then after he went to bed I was able to get on with work. Knowing I had the flexibility to do this at such an important point in his life was fantastic and I'm hugely appreciative of the support I got to do this.`...</div>

<div class='progress-msg'>[11:20:25] Duplicate post wasn't found with unique key `Paul Trenell - When our son Joseph was born I moved onto a compressed hours working pattern after my wife Cathy went back to work. Working 10 days in 9 with every other Friday off to look after Joseph allowed us to limit the number of days that he initially went to nursery, helping to get him ready for school gradually, and saving a bit of money on childcare bills!.  There were some challenges, and Thursdays were often busy, but that chance to spend some regular father-son time with Joseph was priceless. I taught him to ride his bike and took him on his first camping trip on these days, which are memories I will never forget. 

When he started school earlier this year I reverted to full-time, but now use flexi-time to drop him off each morning and pick him up from school early every other Friday, which is a treat. I've been very grateful to be able to balance my work and home life like this, and pleased by how supportive bosses and colleagues have been.`...</div>

I also work one day a week from home so that I can be available to pick up from school and get the children fed before they have to go on to other activities so that my wife can have at least one day working later at work if required.

This flexibility in my working arrangements is a great help to our family; cutting back on commuting time and costs, plus the environmental benefit of less mileage means it positively impacts both my engagement with the business, but also my overall feeling of wellbeing.

Performance in the business is not measured by hours in the office so such flexible arrangements are in no way a barrier to success.`...</div>

<div class='progress-msg'>[11:20:26] Duplicate post wasn't found with unique key `Rachel Bridges - Throughout my returning to practice training I was able to complete my required hours by doing 3 days a week.  The department were very supportive and flexible in allowing me to work which days suited me best.  Upon starting back work officially as a Diagnostic Radiographer the department again was happy for me to undertake 3 days a week work which suited me and my husband.  My husband was able to plan out his working days around when I was due to work, so when he had his days off I was at work and vice versa.  My family were also very supportive and helped with childcare whenever we needed it.  It was tricky at first and initially I had my reservations that it would work but 3 years on and it's worked out great.  I'm now slowly building up to full time hours with both my children starting full time at school it has become a lot easier.

If you are considering returning to practice, I'd say go for it! It's not as difficult as you imagine it to be and don't be afraid to contact people to ask for help to get started. I found a return to practice radiography course which included clinical placements at nearby University Hospital Leicester. It will be nerve-racking when you first start back but that will pass and it's well worth it in the end!`...</div>

<div class='progress-msg'>[11:20:27] Duplicate post wasn't found with unique key `Rambaut Fairley - As father to 2 year old identical twins, parenthood has always involved juggling urgent priorities. And it has always been really important to me to play a full and active part in my children's lives; work needs to manage around that.

When my girls were 6 months old my wife went back to work full-time, at my request, and I took over looking after them day-to-day on shared parental leave. It was a massive sacrifice for her to give up 6 months of her maternity leave, but one she gladly made for our family.  It was the most amazing 6 months, and I am eternally grateful.

Once I reached the end of my 6 months of parental leave I returned to work 4 days a week, and my wife dropped down to 4 days as well. We both have the same day off, Friday, which let's us spend 3 days together as a family. It also provides a bit of insurance if one of us needs to travel for work, although we have only had to use that twice in 18 months.

My employer has been very supportive, and never questioned whether it was possible to do my role on 4 days a week. Fridays are protected and moving down to 4 days hasn't stopped me being home for bath time whenever I'm not travelling.

It's really important for our business, and for all businesses, to have leaders who demonstrate that flexible working is effective, and can even be encouraged. I don't really like the term role-model, but it is really gratifying to be told that your example has encouraged others.`...</div>

This allows me to take my 2 children to school most mornings, and saves money on childcare. It also means I spend more time with my children and save money. It can be tricky sometimes managing meetings with customers when I have to leave early in the morning because of long driving times. My line manager has given me the flexibility to get on with the job, essentially. He has a fairly light touch approach, which suits me perfectly.

<div class='progress-msg'>[11:20:28] Duplicate post wasn't found with unique key `Robert Oldham - I currently work 28 hours a week over 4 days (having a Wednesday off as a rest mid-week). I have flexibility in my role so can do 2 days working from home and 2 days in the office but generally do 3 days in the office and 1 from home I have MS (Multiple Sclerosis) and find a full 35 hour week exhausting to the extent that I can't enjoy family time at the weekend. A little over 4 years ago I made the decision to reduce my hours to give me a break during the week. This has given me my weekends back and I'm so glad that I made the decision.

The benefits are easy - more energy to enjoy the weekend and the business has benefitted to, as I am able to bring the best of myself on the days when I'm working. If I am not feeling great on any day, I have the flexibility to work from home to avoid the commute.

In all honesty the biggest challenge is coming into a fuller inbox in the morning after my day off - sometimes it can feel like you've been on holiday. Inevitably you will miss some meetings or updates on your day off but with modern technology it's easy to get back up to speed.

My line manager has been very supportive and fully supports flexible working. A number of people in my team work different patterns, from part time to compressed working weeks. The bank is also very supportive of different ways of working and has embraced working from home and flexible working spaces such as hub-sites and areas where you can book a desk in a different location to your main site. We have a weekly team meeting on a Thursday so everyone attends that and flexes their work week around that day.`...</div>

<div class='progress-msg'>[11:20:28] Duplicate post wasn't found with unique key `Sam White and Will McDonald - Sam: It's useful to have a second brain and we often spark ideas off one another. We work well together and we get on. We sometimes think in different ways, so it can be great to get an alternative perspective.

Will: We hear a lot about flexible working, but I see it differently. Non-standard hours are not 'flexible' - it's the 9-5, five-days-a-week kind of hours that are inflexible. If we can move away from set thinking about how and when we work, we create more opportunities for everyone.

Sam: When we took on this role we made a conscious decision to be advocates and role models for flexibility. We are no less ambitious or any less committed because we are choosing to do a job-share. We have a big role and a strategy to deliver. This isn't a case of us 'leaning out' - it's a trade-off for a period of time with our families. Flexibility is integral to modern business. Good people will leave if it isn't there.`...</div>

<div class='progress-msg'>[11:20:29] Duplicate post wasn't found with unique key `Samantha Clarke - When I first fell pregnant, I had started to reap the rewards of 5 years of study to qualify as a chartered surveyor and working through a deep recession. I did not want to give up my career, but also could not see how I could balance my job with a new family, as I worked long hours in London.

My employers agreed that I could return on a 3 day week. I found this stressful however, as there was an expectation to complete the work of 5 days in 3 and I got calls from the office on my days off.  Overnight trips proved difficult, especially if my child was sick.

An opportunity arose within a new property company based at home. I was clear about my working days - Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays - this pattern meant that if I was ever needed by the office on a non-working day - I would always be in the office tomorrow. The pattern also made managing matters at home easier, as I was never working two days in a row, and could accommodate parent consultations, sports days and performances. This arrangement worked well for 18 years. During this time I had two further children with maternity leave, became Company Secretary, a Director and finally Chief Executive! Now my children are much older, I flex my working days more.

These two different environments taught me the need for an agreed working structure, mutual respect for it, and realistic expectations of what can be achieved. When all of these are present, combining a career and family is hugely rewarding and confidence boosting. Whilst there have been situations where my family time has been compromised, these are far outweighed by the financial benefit of working, which all of the family members benefit from.`...</div>

<div class='progress-msg'>[11:20:29] Duplicate post wasn't found with unique key `Sara Abbonizio - I work full-time, but there are two weeks a year I don't work. I take these in August when both Houses of Commons and Lords are typically on recess, so it's generally a quieter period for my team. This pattern means our family can spend dedicated time together over the summer and also that my partner and I can cover most of the school holidays between us. We don't have any family living nearby, so this is important to us. My working week involves working from home two days a week when I can be around for school drop-off and pick-up and also that all important networking with parents and teachers.

My partner works a similar pattern, so we only need childcare for one day a week. The key to making this pattern work is good communication, organisation and the technology that's available today. I submitted a business case after thinking through the requirements on the work and home front and then discussing these with my manager. There's inevitably a period of adjustment with a new pattern,  but these challenges can be worked through in a collaborative environment and the benefits are significant. I feel lucky to have a pattern that enables me to do a rewarding job, while not missing out on quality time with my children as they grow-up.`...</div>

<div class='progress-msg'>[11:20:30] Duplicate post wasn't found with unique key `Sarah Bastajian - My husband also works for Willmott Dixon and was keen to have time at home with the children. We decided to ask to have alternate Mondays off. It works really well, the twins get the best of both of us and we get equal time with them. 

My husband, who is a building manager, was a bit nervous about proposing dropping a day a fortnight. He put it to his boss that if he was off on holiday his construction manager would need to cover for him. He needn't have worried, though, he said it was the easiest conversation he ever had. I knew that my boss would say yes because I was already working four days a week. The arrangement would mean I was doing one day a fortnight more. 

As my job is office-based and my husband is on site I am more flexible during the week which means it is easier for me to do drop-offs and pick-ups of children as I can pick up work in the evenings if I need to. 

Both of us share time off for sick children, based on whose diary is the busiest at the time.`...</div>

<div class='progress-msg'>[11:20:34] Duplicate post wasn't found with unique key `Stuart Anderson - I work Mon - Thurs - 7am - 5pm - a combination of working on-site and at home. I decided to work flexibly to spend more time with my young children, reduce childcare / travel costs and to rethink my approach to work/personal life. The benefits of this working pattern are being able to be part of taking and picking up my children to nursery and school. 

These are special moments and the child you interact with in the morning / afternoon versus the one when you arrive home late from work can be very different. Fun Friday's in our house are always a hit.

The ability to work from home when your day doesn't merit a trip into the office is extremely helpful in helping you be more efficient, reducing the stress of public transport and giving you some more time back in the evening. The challenge I've had with this working pattern is rethinking how I plan my working week. I've had to beef up my prioritisation skills to ensure I make the most of my 4 days in the office. Equally, disciplining myself to switch off on a Friday and focus my energy on my time with my children. 

My employer/line manager has supported me by firstly embracing the idea and allowing me to demonstrate that it would not have any detrimental impact on my performance. It's had the opposite effect as I now feel like I am more productive and happier when I am at work as I'm not making any significant trade offs at home to further my career.`...</div>

<div class='progress-msg'>[11:20:34] Duplicate post wasn't found with unique key `Sue-Beaumont Staite - Since the birth of my first child in 2008 I have been able to balance a career I am passionate about with spending quality time with my family by taking advantage of job sharing, a form of flexible working which I think is still underutilised yet has enormous benefits for both the employer and the employee.

I have worked with two different job share partners and both times I have been able to work the first three days of the working week with my job share partner working the later three days. This enabled us to have a 'cross-over' day in the office where we could catch up and discuss work priorities.

As a working mum with a long commute I found working as a job share not only meant that I wasn't coming back into work at the start of the week to an overwhelming inbox but it also enriched the work I delivered and my job satisfaction - there is truth in the old adage that 'two heads are better than one'. In both of my job share roles I have enjoyed being able to bounce ideas off someone else and take on board any differing perspectives and ideas they might have. It definitely improved our productivity, creativity and commitment to success in that role. It also enabled us to balance a stretching job with caring commitments.`...</div>

advisory and non-executive roles, and be involved with mid-week family life. This means I typically spend two days per week working from home and do between two and four 12-hour shifts (including some nights) per month on the lifeboat.

When in the office, I focus on face-to-face meetings, collaboration and supporting my team and can do my desk-work pretty much anywhere: mostly at home but also at the lifeboat station between exercises and shouts. At TigerWit, we  are creating a culture around flexibility, celebrating achievement and accommodating numerous working styles so that our employees can enjoy flexibility too and are more motivated and loyal as a result.

I have built advisory and non-executive work in to my professional life as I value a portfolio of interests and each role I have benefits, in some way, the others.

I have a young family and it is important to me to be involved in their lives. Whilst our schedule is full on, I believe my wife (who also works flexibly), my children and myself have richer lives as a result of this work-life balance.`...</div>

<div class='progress-msg'>[11:20:35] Duplicate post wasn't found with unique key `Tim Morrell - My wife and I both work a four-day week; I take every Friday off to look after my 2 young sons.  

Having kids feels like a pretty wonderful thing and I'm aware how quickly they will grow up. It seems totally logical to try and be around for them as much as I can and my employer has been super flexible.  

Once they're both in school I think we'll try and shift to a more Scandi model of shorter days (maybe 4 days over 5) so we can spend time together as a family most days though that may be a challenge to fit around clients working on a more traditional 9-6 schedule.`...</div>

We're very lucky to have her.

Verity Fenner added: I'm delighted to be a pioneer in this fantastic scheme, which will hopefully kick start initiatives not only across our industry, but all others too. Working on a permanent contract, but only 2 days a week, gives me so much flexibility with not only work, but with my 2 year old Son too. It's the dream more people should be asking for and pushing for. Dad's too. Lots of agencies talk about these things but don't actually follow through, so I'm determined to shine a light on AMV's willingness to try something new that's so desperately needed.`...</div>

This is very important to me - intellectually, emotionally and financially.

In offering flexible working, companies can cheaply access an experienced and enthusiastic talent pool.  There are millions of people who are unable to commit to a conventional, full-time job, and yet who are skilled, experienced and keen to work.  Companies who can offer them employment will build a loyal, productive, efficient and diverse workforce.  We know that there is a positive, measurable correlation between teams who embrace cognitive diversity and teams who exhibit high performance levels.  

The successful company of the future will clearly be a company with a wide range of working patterns worked by a wide range of individuals.`...</div>
