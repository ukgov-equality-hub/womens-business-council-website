Throughout life there are many competing demands on our time which can make balancing them with work seem challenging. Whether it’s caring for young children or elderly relatives, upskilling, dealing with a health issue or pursuing a personal passion. Sometimes it’s the demands of a second job.

#100WaysToWorkFlexibly is about the Women’s Business Council showcasing the myriad of flexible, dynamic and agile working patterns that can help make that balance possible. So that there’s better awareness of all the different options available.

That’s why #100WaysToWorkFlexibly is telling the stories of men and women of different ages and backgrounds. People who have found a way to work which is right for them, and their employer. 

## Types of flexible working 

### Flexitime

Choosing when to start and end work (within agreed limits) but with certain ‘core hours’, for example, 10am to 4pm every day.

### Part time

Working less than full-time hours (usually by working fewer days).

### Compressed hours

Working full-time hours but over fewer days.

### Working from home and remote working

It might be possible to do some, or all, of the work from home or anywhere else other than the normal place of work.

### Annualised hours

Working a certain number of hours over the year but having some flexibility about when you work. For this pattern, there are sometimes ‘core hours’, but the rest of the hours are worked flexibly or when there’s extra demand at work. Please see below for examples of this working pattern in action.

### Job share and job split

Two people do one job and split the hours, or one job is split into 2 components which 2 different people take forward. For this pattern, when a job is split, each of the 2 work streams can constitute a full-time or part-time position. Please see below for examples of this working pattern in action.

### Term-time working & full-time part year

Working a particular number of weeks per year on either a full or part-time basis. For this pattern, non-working time is generally scheduled at regular, planned periods which are accounted for by a combination of annual leave and unpaid leave. Designated working weeks will normally coincide with busy periods for the business, school terms or Parliamentary sitting periods. Please see below for examples of this working pattern in action.

### Staggered hours

Having different start, finish and break times from other workers.

Flexitime, part time

On becoming pregnant with my first of 2 children it was clear to me that I wanted to continue working but keep a healthy work life balance. My employer was very accommodating, I was able to customise my hours from the children starting nursery then primary and through to secondary education. Working 4 shorter days allowed for morning drop offs, leaving Friday for family time. 

Over the years I have altered my hours to suit school. I now work 5 days a week with 3 of those as shorter days. I learned very early on that planning and organisation were key to the success of working these shorter hours. The flexibility afforded to me by my employer has meant I have been able to be around for my children which has also given peace of mind to my husband who works away from home time to time.
