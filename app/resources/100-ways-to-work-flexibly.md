---

Throughout life there are many competing demands on our time which can make balancing them with work seem challenging. Whether it’s caring for young children or elderly relatives, upskilling, dealing with a health issue or pursuing a personal passion. Sometimes it’s the demands of a second job.

#100WaysToWorkFlexibly is about the Women’s Business Council showcasing the myriad of flexible, dynamic and agile working patterns that can help make that balance possible. So that there’s better awareness of all the different options available.

That’s why #100WaysToWorkFlexibly is telling the stories of men and women of different ages and backgrounds. People who have found a way to work which is right for them, and their employer. 

## Types of flexible working 

### Flexitime

Choosing when to start and end work (within agreed limits) but with certain ‘core hours’, for example, 10am to 4pm every day.

### Part time

Working less than full-time hours (usually by working fewer days).

### Compressed hours

Working full-time hours but over fewer days.

### Working from home and remote working

It might be possible to do some, or all, of the work from home or anywhere else other than the normal place of work.

### Annualised hours

Working a certain number of hours over the year but having some flexibility about when you work. For this pattern, there are sometimes ‘core hours’, but the rest of the hours are worked flexibly or when there’s extra demand at work. Please see below for examples of this working pattern in action.

### Job share and job split

Two people do one job and split the hours, or one job is split into 2 components which 2 different people take forward. For this pattern, when a job is split, each of the 2 work streams can constitute a full-time or part-time position. Please see below for examples of this working pattern in action.

### Term-time working and full-time part year

Working a particular number of weeks per year on either a full or part-time basis. For this pattern, non-working time is generally scheduled at regular, planned periods which are accounted for by a combination of annual leave and unpaid leave. Designated working weeks will normally coincide with busy periods for the business, school terms or Parliamentary sitting periods. Please see below for examples of this working pattern in action.

### Staggered hours

Having different start, finish and break times from other workers.

## Case studies

### Julie Sands

Credit Control Manager
Employer: Aqualisa Products Ltd
Sector: Manufacturing

Flexible working patterns: Flexitime, part time

 >On becoming pregnant with my first of 2 children it was clear to me that I wanted to continue working but keep a healthy work life balance. My employer was very accommodating, I was able to customise my hours from the children starting nursery then primary and through to secondary education. Working 4 shorter days allowed for morning drop offs, leaving Friday for family time. 

> Over the years I have altered my hours to suit school. I now work 5 days a week with 3 of those as shorter days. I learned very early on that planning and organisation were key to the success of working these shorter hours. The flexibility afforded to me by my employer has meant I have been able to be around for my children which has also given peace of mind to my husband who works away from home time to time.

### Tim Hughes

CEO
Employer: Tigerwit
Sector: Financial services

Flexible working patterns: Flexitime

> I work fulltime hours on a flexi-time, flexi-location basis to enable me to volunteer on the RNLI Chiswick lifeboat, retain additional advisory and non-executive roles, and be involved with mid-week family life. This means I typically spend 2 days per week working from home and do between 2 and 4 12-hour shifts (including some nights) per month on the lifeboat.

> When in the office, I focus on face-to-face meetings, collaboration and supporting my team and can do my desk-work pretty much anywhere: mostly at home but also at the lifeboat station between exercises and shouts. At TigerWit, we are creating a culture around flexibility, celebrating achievement and accommodating numerous working styles so that our employees can enjoy flexibility too and are more motivated and loyal as a result.

> I have built advisory and non-executive work into my professional life as I value a portfolio of interests and each role I have benefits, in some way, the others. 

> I have a young family and it is important to me to be involved in their lives. Whilst our schedule is full on, I believe my wife (who also works flexibly), my children and myself have richer lives as a result of this work-life balance.

### Tim Morrell

Lead Inventor
Employer: ?What If! Innovation
Sector: Professional services

Flexible working patterns: Flexitime, part time

> My wife and I both work a 4-day week; I take every Friday off to look after my 2 young sons. Having kids feels like a pretty wonderful thing and I’m aware how quickly they will grow up. It seems totally logical to try and be around for them as much as I can and my employer has been super flexible.

> Once they’re both in school I think we’ll try and shift to a more Scandi model of shorter days (maybe 4 days over 5) so we can spend time together as a family most days though that may be a challenge to fit around clients working on a more traditional 9-6 schedule.

### Nicola Balfour

People Manager
Employer: Greggs
Sector: Retail

Flexible working patterns: Flexitime

> My son recently started school and it came at a time when my partner was working away. It was very important for me to be able to do both drop off and pick up whilst he settled into a new routine.

> For a 2-3 week period I flexed my working hours to be able to do this, I was in the office during school hours, I was able to spend some time with my son after school and then after he went to bed I was able to get on with work. Knowing I had the flexibility to do this at such an important point in his life was fantastic and I’m hugely appreciative of the support I got to do this.

### Paul Trenell

Head of Analytical Services
Employer: Civil Service, GEO
Sector: Public sector

Flexible working patterns: Flexitime, compressed hours

When our son Joseph was born I moved onto a compressed hours working pattern after my wife Cathy went back to work. Working 10 days in 9 with every other Friday off to look after Joseph allowed us to limit the number of days that he initially went to nursery, helping to get him ready for school gradually, and saving a bit of money on childcare bills! There were some challenges, and Thursdays were often busy, but that chance to spend some regular father-son time with Joseph was priceless. I taught him to ride his bike and took him on his first camping trip on these days, which are memories I will never forget.

When he started school earlier this year I reverted to full-time, but now use flexi-time to drop him off each morning and pick him up from school early every other Friday, which is a treat. I’ve been very grateful to be able to balance my work and home life like this, and pleased by how supportive bosses and colleagues have been.

### Steve Beswick

Business Development Director for Surface in Education (EMEA)
Employer: Microsoft
Sector: IT, tech

Flexible working patterns: Flexitime

> In 2009 after 15 years at Microsoft I was offered a sabbatical from work for 3 months. This was a reward for tenure at Microsoft, plus also performance levels being high. Microsoft offered this with full pay and rewards. This was a once in a lifetime opportunity to have this much time off work so I planned a trip around the world with my 18 year old daughter. Ten years on we still talk about the adventure we had and places we visited. Not many Dads could do this with their children and I am eternally grateful to Microsoft for giving me this opportunity. It was a great way of saying thank you for the work I have done.

> Today, I have just been appointed to a senior volunteering role which will require 15 days of my time a year. Working closely with my manager and HR I have agreed a flexible work pattern to accommodate these days. With technology now work can happen anywhere and at any time. Technology along with flexible rules from my employer on work patterns allows me to use my skills in a very different way for a very good cause.

### Nicholas David

IT Team
Employer: Willmott Dixon
Sector: Construction

Flexible working patterns: Flexitime

> I feel that it’s great that agile working is now available to people in IT and that, for me, I like the fact that we are trusted to use the flexible approach and to use it as and when necessary as long as the business is not adversely affected by it.

### Mitch (Michele Oliver)

Global Marketing & Purpose VP
Employer: Mars Incorporated
Sector: Food and beverages

Flexible working patterns: Flexitime, working from home and remote working, part time

> The flexibility of working from home during the hours that work for me makes an enormous difference to my life and my family. Prior to this role I worked 3 days a week for 7 years after my son Albie was born, in roles spanning global marketing and UK Strategy – delivering value to Mars and enabling me to be the parent and partner that I wanted to be. I was promoted in that time which is a true testament to Mars’ support for talent and not work patterns!

> Immediately before this role I was Marketing VP for the UK with a team of 70 and on the UK Board – I worked 4 days a week as the business focuses on quality of output not hours of input. To this day I maintain that my one day off made me significantly better equipped to deliver my role – giving me space and perspective to rise above the busy-ness that comes with these roles and focus on what really matters. I am a passionate advocate of flexible working and valuing the work delivered rather than the hours worked.

### Mike Rankine

Business Manager to Head of Transaction Banking
Employer: Royal Bank Scotland
Sector: Finance

Flexible working patterns: Flexitime, working from home and remote working

> I work standard office hours throughout the week, in London Monday to Wednesday and from home Thursday & Friday. I have a daughter from a previous relationship and look after her 50% of the time; working from home 2 days a week allows me to take her to and from school on those days.

> Quite simply, this working pattern allows me to support a 50% shared custody of my daughter. If I couldn’t have worked flexibly this wouldn’t be possible and I would see her far less. I also now have a 1-year old son and flexible working has allowed me to spend more time with him as I am home much earlier without a 90-minute commute.

> It can be challenging when face-to-face meetings are organised on my home working days, but I can usually move things around with enough notice. Having fixed days from home at the end of the week does also often mean missing out on office social occasions!

> My employer and various line managers have been very supportive. From an employer point of view, we increasingly have new technologies to support home working, such as Zoom video conferencing that allows people to join meetings F2F from wherever they are. My line managers have always been very understanding and have helped me to manage time effectively so that not being in the office is not a disadvantage in any way.

> I previously worked a different pattern that varied week-to-week whereby I would work longer hours in the office in London and then school hours from home. Sometimes it was 3 in London, 2 from home, others it was 4 in London with 1 from home and also 2 in London, 3 from home. Because this varied it was difficult to ever explain to anyone what my working pattern was, but I always ensured my work diary reflected where I would be and when I was available. With effective and efficient time management, you can make just about any pattern work.
