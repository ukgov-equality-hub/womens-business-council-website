The Women's Business Council (WBC) works to maximise women’s potential in the workplace. 

It focuses on industry sectors with the most significant gender pay gaps and or underrepresentation of women. It aims to improve women’s representation within the workplace on a national level. 

The WBC is a government-backed, business-led initiative which reports to the Minister for Women and Equalities.
