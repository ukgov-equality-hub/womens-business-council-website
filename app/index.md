            The Women's Business Council (WBC) works to maximise women’s potential in the workplace.
        </p>
        <p>
            It focuses on industry sectors with the most significant gender pay gaps and or underrepresentation of women.
            It aims to improve women’s representation within the workplace on a national level.
        </p>
        <p>
            The WBC is a government-backed, business-led initiative which reports to the Minister for Women and Equalities.
