Suzannah Nichol OBE has been Chief Executive of Build UK, the leading representative organisation for the UK construction industry since 2015.

Inspired by a site visit during a week’s work experience, Suzannah achieved a degree in Construction Management before starting her career as a site engineer. She then qualified as a health and safety professional before taking over the reins at the National Specialist Contractors’ Council. After 13 years leading the specialist sector, Suzannah was the driving force behind the merger to form Build UK in 2015, bringing the industry together within one organisation. Under her leadership, Build UK is at the forefront of improving business performance, increasing productivity and recruiting, training and retaining talent across the industry.

A passionate advocate for construction, Suzannah is recognised and respected for her work with government, media and key industry stakeholders. She was awarded an OBE in 2024 for her service to the construction industry. Suzannah was one of the first Timewise Power Part-Timers, is a member of the Construction Leadership Council (CLC), the Building Advisory Committee (BAC) which advises the Building Safety Regulator and the Advisory Board of the Circle Partnership. She is also a non-executive director of CSCS Ltd and the Peoples Pension Holdings Ltd.
