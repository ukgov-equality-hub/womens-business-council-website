title: About the Women’s Business Council
---

The Women’s Business Council (WBC) is a government-backed, business-led group that reports to the Minister for Women and Equalities.

The government established the WBC in 2012, to advise it on maximising women’s contribution to economic growth. The council’s chair, members and terms of reference have changed several times since then to ensure it reflects the best of British business and meets the government’s aspirations.

Mary Macleod, Chief Executive of Business in the Community, is the current chair.

The WBC’s members are senior business leaders who are passionate about empowering women in the workplace. The council believes that gender equality can boost productivity, innovation and competitiveness.

The WBC works with businesses, policymakers and other stakeholders to identify and remove the barriers that women face at different stages of their lives and careers.
