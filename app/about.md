title: About the Women’s Business Council
---

The government established the WBC in 2012 to advise it on maximising women’s contribution to economic growth. We work with businesses, policymakers and other stakeholders to identify and remove the barriers that women face at different stages of their lives and careers.

The WBC was relaunched in 2019 to focus on the sectors that have the most significant gender pay gaps, and to improve women’s representation within the workplace.

The WBC is a government-backed, business-led initiative which reports to the Minister for Women and Equalities.
 
## Objectives

Our objectives are to:

* help to develop and implement tailored actions to tackle the gender pay gap in target sectors
* encourage local initiatives to drive action to tackle the gender pay gap at a local or regional level
* advise the government on issues facing priority sectors, future changes to the gender pay gap regulations, and barriers to women’s economic participation
* work in partnership across the business community on specific issues
* take a national role in sharing good practice

## Council members

[Our members](/members) are senior business leaders working across a range of sectors who are passionate about empowering women in the workplace. We believe that gender equality can boost productivity, innovation and competitiveness.
