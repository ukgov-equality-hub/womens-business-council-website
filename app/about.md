title: About the Women’s Business Council
---

The Women’s Business Council (WBC) is a government-backed, business-led group that reports to the Minister for Women and Equalities.

The government established the WBC in 2012, to advise it on maximising women’s contribution to economic growth. The council’s chair, members and terms of reference have changed several times since then to ensure it reflects the best of British business and meets the government’s aspirations.
 
## Objectives
 
The WBC works with businesses, policymakers and other stakeholders to identify and remove the barriers that women face at different stages of their lives and careers.

The Council’s objectives are to:

* help to develop and implement tailored actions to tackle the gender pay gap in target sectors
* take a national role in sharing good practice
* advise government on the issues facing priority sectors, future changes to the Gender Pay Gap regulations, and barriers to women’s economic participation
* work in partnership across the business community on specific issues
* encourage local initiatives to drive action to tackle the gender pay gap at a local or regional level

## Council members

The WBC’s members are senior business leaders working across a range of sectors who are passionate about empowering women in the workplace. The council believes that gender equality can boost productivity, innovation and competitiveness.

Mary Macleod, Chief Executive of Business in the Community, is the current chair.

## Key sectors

The Council’s focus currently includes the following sectors:

* construction
* finance and insurance
* retail
* tech

The Council also has a focus on small and medium enterprises, as these employ a significant number of people across a range of sectors.

The Council will work with regional organisations, local partners and business organisations to support initiatives to address the gender pay gap at a local and regional level.
