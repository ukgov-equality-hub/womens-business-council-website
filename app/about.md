title: About the Women’s Business Council
---

The government established the WBC in 2012 to advise it on maximising women’s contribution to economic growth. We work with businesses, policymakers and other stakeholders to identify and remove the barriers that women face at different stages of their lives and careers.

The WBC was refreshed in 2025 as part of the government’s commitment to grow the economy and improve women’s economic participation.

The WBC is a government-backed, business-led initiative which reports to the Minister for Women and Equalities.
 
## Objectives

The WBC will be driving forward agreed work programmes that support women’s pay, progression, and productivity. This will support the government's [growth mission](https://www.gov.uk/missions/economic-growth) and the [industrial strategy](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/industrial-strategy).

## Council members

[Our members](/members/) are senior business leaders working across a range of sectors who are passionate about empowering women in the workplace. We believe that gender equality can boost productivity, innovation and competitiveness.

Mary Macleod, Partner and Chair, Board & CEO Practice at August Leadership, is the current chair.
